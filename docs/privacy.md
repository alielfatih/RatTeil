*RatTeil Privacy Policy*

*We Respect Your Privacy*

At RatTeil, we believe in being transparent and honest about how we handle your personal information. And the good news is, we don't collect any! That's right, we don't collect, store, or share any personal information about you.

*What This Means*

- We don't collect any personal information from you, so you don't have to worry about us using it in any way.
- We don't share your information with anyone, because we don't have any information to share.
- We don't retain any data, because we don't collect any in the first place.

*Security*

- We don't need to implement security measures to protect your data, because we don't have any data to protect.

*Changes to This Privacy Policy*

- If we make any changes to this privacy policy (which is unlikely, since we don't collect any data!), we'll post them here.

*Effective Date*

- This privacy policy is effective as of [05/30/2024].

*Contact Us*

- If you have any questions about this privacy policy (although we can't imagine what they would be, since we don't collect any data!), please contact us at alixannu01@gmail.com.

By using RatTeil, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this privacy policy. Thanks for using RatTeil!
